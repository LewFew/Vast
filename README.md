# Vast
new game?

Vast is a 2D top-down game engine that allows for orthogonal(perpendicular) perspective change. Written in pure Java.

Move with WASD to change perspective, press Shift+A to turn left or Shift+D to turn right. The reason the objects look rather strange when
the player moves is because they are at different heights (z-values). Also, the number on the die is to show that changing direction
also changes the side of blocks you see.
